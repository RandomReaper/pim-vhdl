We love pull requests from everyone.

Set up your machine:

    cd pim-vhdl

Make sure the tests pass:

    all.sh

Make your change. Add tests for your change. Make the tests pass:

    cd tb
    all.sh

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](../../compare/)

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within some days. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Follow our [CodingStyle](./README.md#codingstyle).
* Write a good commit message.
